14121612	Christmas	It's Christmas-time There's no need to be afraid. At Christmas-time we let in light and we banish shade. And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy. Throw your arms around the world at Christmas-time. But - say a prayer - pray for the other ones. At Christmas-time it's hard but when you're having fun. There's a world outside your window And it's a world of dread and fear Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears. And the Christmas-bells that ring

3370508	Christmas	Somebody'd say this tree's not real 'Cause it stands there every year But it makes my holiday feel Like Christmas, when Christmas time is here  Some will say it's not about How many gifts are given out It just makes a holiday feel

760931	Christmas	Children carry through the streets A brightly painted star. Angels gather round the hearth, Strumming on guitars. Men of great renown and faith Say prayers on boulevards. It's the night before christmas.  But you don't have to be an angel To sing harmony. You don't have to be a child To love the mystery. (mystery) And you don't have to be a wise man On bended knee. The heart of this christmas is in you and me.    
44561931	Christmas	I'm dreaming of white Christmas, just like ones. I used to know. Where treetops glisten and children listen to hear the sleigh bells in the snow. I'm dreaming of white Christmas with every Christmas card I write.    
47397638	Christmas	"Where Are You Christmas"  Where are you Christmas Why can't I find you Why have you gone away Where is the laughter You used to bring me Why can't I hear music play  My world is changing I'm rearranging Does that mean Christmas changes too    
11115708	Christmas	On Christmas morn, among my toys, I thought I heard, a funny noise, Ran downstairs so I could see, Just what Santa Clause had left for me.  Something barked on Christmas Morning, Underneath our Christmas Tree

Henry Hall and David Lloyd, Betty Grable too-oo-oo.  Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!) We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already. But we had no idea of all the great things in store for us. It all happened really when 'Please Please Me' became a number one hit and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show. This time last year we were all dead chuffed because 'Love Me Do' got into the top twenty and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already. Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everybody who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everybody but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime:  Garry Crimble to you, Garry Mimble to you. Getty Bable, dear Christmas, Happy Birthday me too!  This is Paul here. Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about Birthday cards and parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha-ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you treated us in 1963 and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we'll write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like jelly babies? Well, we used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off jelly babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams, chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing. (Yes! Yes! Oh yes!)

In through the door walks a jolly old man, with a long white beard and gifts in his hand. The kids get to sit down on santas lap, as the gifts, they are handed, are qickly unrapped. The children are probably too young to see it, but under the costume is you brother Robert. Your brother lives not so far from here and he dresses up for them year after year. When you and your husband are out in the hall, he says,'don't you think your brother has grown quite tall.' You notice he's different from how you recall and you realize, this isn't your brother at all.  The land is silent now that all the stars are light. I wish you all a very special christmas night.  He's wearing the same cothes as Robert would wear, but the pants are to short and his ankles are bear. He must have understood your brothers task, killed him and taken his clothes and his mask. Your brothers body is probaly already cold, tossed in a ditch by the side ot the rode . You did not notice that something was wrong, inviting the killer into your home. You wish to confront him, reveal who he is, but he holds his arms around both of your kids. He's in control now he's running the show. But maybe he dosen't know that you know. Just to be certain he isn't your brother, you tell him to pick his favourite liquor. Whiskey is your brothers liquor of choice, this man asks for brandon in a creepy old voice.

38160840	Christmas	Once upon a time, a good many years ago, there was a traveller, and he set out upon a journey. It was a magic journey, and was to seem very long when he began it, and very short when he got half way through. He travelled along a rather dark path for some little time, without meeting anything, until at last he came to a beautiful child. So he said to the child, " What do you do here?" And the child said, " I am always at play. Come and play with me!" So, he played with that child, the whole day long, and they were very merry. The sky was so blue, the sun was so bright, the water was so sparkling, the leaves were so green, the flowers were so lovely, and they heard such singing-birds and saw so many butteries, that everything was beautiful. This was in fine weather. When it rained, they loved to watch the falling drops, and to smell the fresh scents. When it blew, it was delightful to listen to the wind, and fancy what it said, as it came rushing from its home-- where was that, they wondered! bending the trees, rumbling in the chimneys, shaking the house, and making the sea roar in fury. But, when it snowed, that was best of all; for, they liked nothing so well as to look up at the white flakes falling fast and thick, like down from the breasts of millions of white birds; and to see how smooth and deep the drift was; and to listen to the hush upon the paths and roads. They had plenty of the finest toys in the world, and the most astonishing picture-books: all about scimitars and slippers and turbans, and dwarfs and giants and genii and fairies, and blue- beards and bean-stalks and riches and caverns and forests and Valentines and Orsons: and all new and all true. But, one day, of a sudden, the traveller lost the child. He called to him over and over again, but got no answer. So, he went upon his road, and went on for a little while without meeting anything, until at last he came to a handsome boy. So, he said to the boy, " What do you do here?" And the boy said, " I am always learning. Come and learn with me." So he learned with that boy about Jupiter and Juno, and the Greeks and the Romans, and I don't know what, and learned more than I could tell--or he either, for he soon forgot a great deal of it. But, they were not always learning; they had the merriest games that ever were played. They rowed upon the river in summer, and skated on the ice in winter; they were active afoot, and active on horseback; at cricket, and all games at ball; at prisoner's base, hare and hounds, follow my leader, and more sports than I can think of; nobody could beat them. They had holidays too, and Twelfth cakes, and parties where they danced till midnight, and real Theatres where they saw palaces of real gold and silver rise out of the real earth, and saw all the wonders of the world at once. As to friends, they had such dear friends and so many of them, that I want the time to reckon them up. They were all young, like the handsome boy,

Oh Chrissy, the Christmas mouse, Lives in the middle of Santa's house, And all day long she would romp and play, And help Santa load his Christmas sleigh.  Now the story goes that Chrissy's nose, Was also big and bright, But we all know she did not go, On that famous ride that night.  Christmas day found her sad and blue, And Santa said, "What's wrong with you?"

7855438	Christmas	Christmas Eve, 1971. The family visits Granddad at the nuthouse. Vegetative, he says not a word, til the parent's are gone, then he says to the kid: "You know what happens on Christmas Eve? He comes to town to punish the naughty. This is the scariest goddamn night of the year. You see Santa Claus you run for your life!"  With seeds wrought in cruel and traumatizing fear? The madness now begins to take it's root. An evil thing lies coiled behind the tears, it wants to be awakened.  On the way home, in the dark of night, his car blocks the road, he flags them down. Murderous thief in the guise of St. Nick takes advantage of Dad and puts a hole in his head. Billy runs off and hides in the brush While the jolly attacker tries to rape Mom. He tears of her clothes. And she gets in a shot, so he cuts her throat open in the eyes of her son.

43263686	Christmas	Santa Claus Does Not Forget By M. Haley Bertie was a very good boy. He was kind, obedient, truthful and unselfish. He had, however, one great fault — he always forgot. No matter how important the errand, his answer was always, " I forgot." When he was sent with a note to the dressmaker, his mother would find the note in his pocket at night. If he was sent to the store in a great hurry, to get something for tea, he would return late, without the article, but with his usual answer. His father and mother talked the matter over, and decided that something must be done to make the little boy remember. Christmas was near, and Bertie was busy making out a list of things, which Santa Claus was to bring him. "

Now was not this very sweet and loving? One night, after they had gone to bed, Jamie said, " Ted, if Santa Claus brings us skates, Jim can teach us how to use them." Oh, yes; and if we get fur mittens it will be such fun to make a fort." " And a snowman," Jamie answered. Ted went oh: " I'll always ride the sled down a hill, and you can ride it up."

7661397	Christmas	Yeah, I was angry. The kind of angry you can only get in a shopping mall.  It was a beautiful December day. The shiny decorations were up in the store windows And festive music was wafting through the mall air. I was looking for a few more gifts for some of my compadres And thinking I might stop in and say "hi" to Jenny at the Pretzel Palace  When I saw him  There, in the main courtyard, Surrounded by mobs of adoring children, Pretending to be, St. Nicolas.  Garbed in a cheap, red, fleece suit. Where does he get the audacity?! And right there in the middle of the mall, Where all humanity can gaze upon his deception!  And his obvious dissimilarity to the man he is imitating. Even if he does sit there, gloating, on an ornate glowing thrown, Attended by cheap, dime-store elves!  Prosthetic Santa. Your gut is an illusion. I can only surmise, That the twinkle in your eyes, Is as false as your beard.  Prosthetic Santa. You fly a phony reindeer. And your insincere mirth, And your counterfeit girth, Is a flaky veneer.  Granted my eyesight isn't what it used to be After that accident with the baking soda;

You took my heart and soul And before I had a chance to take control We retired to your palace on the Pole Where we only had ourselves And the reindeer and the elves And a lot of things we never said About the life I could have led If I had had the sense to stay away  But here we are Nick And so Nick I know it's time for you to go Nick I know by now I'll never claim you for my own I've been resigned to spend my Christmases alone And so au revoir Nick It's grand Nick I don't pretend to understand Nick

You look like that guy named Drake! You're soft and warm, and a little deformed!" That was good - I need more. I wanna eat a pancake like Thor! Peanut butter, Christmas trees. Don't compare, I need a pancake. Mom and Dad, Santa Claus, all I have is apple sauce! This is lame, I'm running away! But then I found a grittle in my sewer with some mix left. So I'm gonna make a pancake! For my Grandma, Dad, and my Uncle. Aunt Jemima makes me happy! c: Drinking syrup straight from her bottle! I would cook 500 pancakes - their fluffy and their soft. 'Cause you know I love the butter, and you love the Pam! Carrot pancakes on my necklace, glued syrup to my car. Aunt Jemima on my t-shirt, and a speciala in my scarf. I would flip 500 pancakes, and hit your face just once! But I got a pancake baby, and I'll feed your kids.

3459712	Christmas	This Song I Wrote is a far ways away from here. With it, though, I swear you could get your conscience clear. You could make your sobs soak the heart of some financier Who thinks that gold licks the tip of each well-aimed spear. You could demand a recount of any crooked polls. You could uplift your spirits like you're wearing platform souls Or walking round on stilts your heart controls Through choking soldiers bent o'er streets of coals. Yeah, you could go straight to the war-torn wrapped in gauze,  And deep-freeze them with a worthy cause While the breeze through the trees gives applause. You keep walking while the healing thaws Through fields that Cezanne draws You change your feet to tiger's paws Ask which road is Shangri-La's Take a left at the Land of Oz Pass the statue of Santa Claus Then you'll know you're in this song I wrote.  This song I wrote could make a politician sweat. Stab a snapshot future through his conscience like a bayonet. Show him wheelchair dowries in the cradle, crying, "Massive Debt!"

30151116	Christmas	MOTHER TERESA There are a lot of good people in the world. but not many of them are world-famous. Mother Teresa was a small, quiet nun. She died in 1997 in India. but people in many countries remember her. They talk about her they love her. Why? Read her story. The answer is here. Agnes Gonxha For her first eighteen years, her name was not Teresa. It was Agnes. Her family name was Bojaxh There were two children in the family before her: a boy and a girl. Then little Agnes Gonxha came into the world on 26 August 1910. Her mother and father were from Albania. but they lived in the town of Skopje. At that time. Skopje was in Serbia. They had a good home because her father did well in his work. Then her father suddenly died. Agnes was only eight years old. Her sister was fourteen and her brother was eleven. Things were dificult for Agnes's mother, but she was strong for her children. She worked and did well. She loved the children. and they had a happy home. There were some poor people near their home. These people did not have much money for food. and Agnes's mother was good to them too. She was a Christian a Catholic and God was very important to her. She prayed to God every evening with her children. and they all went to church every week. At the church, there were stories about Christian missionaries in India and poor African countries. These people lived for God. They went to India and Africa because they wanted to bring God's love to poor people there. Some of the missionaries in India were men from Skopje. Agnes loved hearing about the work of these missionaries. She started to think, What am I going to do for God?' She wanted to live for God, but how? Did she want to be a nun? Did she want to live ony for God? She prayed for answers. After five years, the answer came to her. She wanted to live only for Him. She wanted to be a nun in India. Her mother was very unhappy about this. She loved her daughter and did not want to say goodbye to her. She went to her bedroom and stayed there all day. But after a day and a night, she came out and said to Agnes. Put your hand in His hand and walk with Him: On 25 September 1928, Agnes said goodbye to her friends and her home in Skopje. At the station, she said goodbye to her family. She was eighteen years old, and she did not see her mother or her sister again. To India She went by train and boat to Ireland. There she went to the home of the Loreto nuns. She wanted to be a Loreto nun because many of them worked in India. Agnes stayed with the nuns at Loreto House in Dublin for six weeks. Then she was on a boat again to India. She was now Sister Teresa. These days, you can get from Ireland to India very quickly, but in those days people were on the boat for seven weeks. It went from Ireland to Spain, then across the Mediterranean Sea to Suez in Egypt, down the Red Sea, across the Arabian Sea to Sri Lanka, and then up to Calcutta in India. From Calcutta, she went by train to Darjeeling. Calcutta was a big place with a lot of noise, but Dageeling was quiet and beautiful. Young Sister Teresa did not know much English. but she was a good student. She was friendly too and she often smiled. She was very happy there. After two years, her English was good, and she started to teach children in the nuns' school. Then she moved to one of the Loreto nuns' schools in Calcutta. Its name was Loreto Entally, a big school for girls.

2291999	Christmas	One Christmas was so much like the other, in those years around the sea-town corner now, out of all sound except the distant speaking of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve, or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six. All the Christmases roll down towards the two-tongued sea, like a cold and headlong moon bundling down the sky that was our street; and they stop at the rim of the ice-edged, fish-freezing waves, and I plunge my hands in the snow and bring out whatever I can find. In goes my hand into that wool-white bell-tongued ball of holidays resting at the rim of the carol-singing sea, and out come Mrs. Prothero and the firemen. It was on the afternoon of the day of Christmas Eve, and I was in Mrs. Prothero's garden, waiting for cats, with her son Jim. It was snowing. It was always snowing at Christmas. December, in my memory, is white as Lapland, although there were no reindeers. But there were cats. Patient, cold and callous, our hands wrapped in socks, we waited to snowball the cats. Sleek and long as jaguars and horrible-whiskered, spitting and snarling, they would slide and sidle over the white back-garden walls, and the lynx-eyed hunters, Jim and I, fur-capped and moccasined trappers from Hudson Bay, off Mumbles Road, would hurl our deadly snowballs at the green of their eyes. The wise cats never appeared. We were so still, Eskimo-footed arctic marksmen in the muffling silence of the eternal snows—eternal, ever since Wednesday—that we never heard Mrs. Prothero's first cry from her igloo at the bottom of the garden. Or, if we heard it at all, it was, to us, like the far-off challenge of our enemy and prey, the neighbor's polar cat. But soon the voice grew louder. " Fire!" cried Mrs. Prothero, and she beat the dinner-gong. And we ran down the garden, with the snowballs in our arms, towards the house; and smoke, indeed, was pouring out of the dining-room, and the gong was bombilating, and Mrs. Prothero was announcing ruin like a town crier in Pompeii. This was better than all the cats in Wales standing on the wall in a row. We bounded into the house, laden with snowballs, and stopped at the open door of the smoke-filled room. Something was burning all right; perhaps it was Mr. Prothero, who always slept there after midday dinner with a newspaper over his face. But he was standing in the middle of the room, saying, " A fine Christmas!" and smacking at the smoke with a slipper. Call the fire brigade," cried Mrs. Prothero as she beat the gong. " They won't be here," said Mr. Prothero, "it's Christmas." There was no fire to be seen, only clouds of smoke and Mr. Prothero standing in the middle of them, waving his slipper as though he were conducting. Do something," he said. And we threw all our snowballs into the smoke—I think we missed Mr. Prothero—and ran out of the house to the telephone box. Let's call the police as well," Jim said. And the ambulance." And Ernie Jenkins, he likes fires." But we only called the fire brigade, and soon the fire engine came and three tall men in helmets brought a hose into the house and Mr. Prothero got out just in time before they turned it on. Nobody could have had a noisier Christmas Eve. And when the firemen turned off the hose and were standing in the wet, smoky room, Jim's Aunt, Miss Prothero, came downstairs and peered in at them. Jim and I waited, very quietly, to hear what she would say to them. She said the right thing, always. She looked at the three tall firemen in their shining helmets, standing among the smoke and cinders and dissolving snowballs, and she said: " Would you like anything to read?" Years and years ago, when I was a boy, when there were wolves in Wales, and birds the color of red-flannel petticoats whisked past the harp-shaped hills, when we sang and wallowed all night and day in caves that smelt like Sunday afternoons in damp front farmhouse parlors, and we chased, with the jawbones of deacons, the English and the bears, before the motor car, before the wheel, before the duchess-faced horse, when we rode the daft and happy hills bareback, it snowed and it snowed. But here a small boy says: " It snowed last year, too. I made a snowman and my brother knocked it down and I knocked my brother down and then we had tea."

And  It's called "Christmas" What more can I say?

Hear the sirens screaming out in the distance Hold your family close to your heart  American justice, American lies A war of words that I despise I wish the good cops, if they exist, the very best And a bullet for all the  Complications, injustice Deliberations, what's the deal? They fake it, we break it And take back what they steal  We could rise, black and white Unbound, and make them pay For every tear, for every fear Defend our yesterdays  We could rise, black and white And make them pay For every tear, for every fear Defend our yesterdays  When they dropped the bomb on the building to kill a movement Did they care where the rights of the murdered went? Police terror in the eyes of the children

7818941	Nature	Almost everyday we hear about how some processed, refined, pesticide-ridden or over-cooked food has been found to be carcinogenic. Yet people will rarely look at or question their own diet, what they eat and how it's prepared. Despite our lengthy time on earth it has been a relatively short time in the scheme of things that humankind has harnessed fire and used it for cooking, as well as begun to refrigerate, irradiate, and store our food in plastic and glass containers and packaging. We consume a diet of garbage and then pay the price for it. Eat lesser, eat better, eat rawer, eat organic.

1956971	Nature	Infant' graves are steps of angels, where Earth's brightest gems of innocence repose. God is their parent, and they need no tear; He takes them to His bosom from earth's woes, A bud their lifetime and a flower their close. Their spirits are an Iris of the skies, Needing no prayers; a sunset's happy close. Gone are the bright rays of their soft blue eyes;    
11468965	Nature	A high and lonesome sound Comes in to lay you down You crawl below within The pines are whispering  Behold the wilderness Where men get lost and press Their luck in hopelessness Come on, get up, get dressed  High atop some ferris wheel Sat to watch the autumn peel Yet again a gloaming sky If there's shadow, there is light  Smokestacks along the coast

587633	Nature	A contraband on the nature of emotion Missing teeth from illusions of stability Trapped inside this mental coffin Only opinion that ever mattered was to them This conscience will explore truth of greed Bottled up perception in a locked out age This time let's make it fact Savor this moment of antagonistic behavior Precede with an array of actions induced with an arousal of dislikes Simply forcing this discomfort View of spirit, will not obey Bastard entity that speaks for your god Traits of power influenced on sheep-like minds

Fast through the winding woods we push Flash of a tail within the bush For the stag is swift and the stag is fleet And he hears the sound of thundering feet  Here then gone, clansmen cry, "The hunt is on!"  It is more than sport 'tween beast and man, For the stag is sacred to our clan And we dare not risk the forest's ire For if we can't kill then We'd best not fire

9372363	Nature	So the story was told to me with patience. Oblivious to your eyes as I lay in silence. If memory serves me right you're unkind, impatient, but then again just who am I to describe the failings of a lesser being.

15362132	Nature	Nothing ever prepared me for this moment nothing has led up to this ordeal the life I knew is gone – twice over broken and my fate it must be sealed.

12024574	Nature	You were the left hand and I was the right You were the darkness and I was the light But nothing's the same since the horrible night When Gemini fell from the sky Your transient whispers were lost in the air When the oceanside breeze came and swept through your hair And the heavens were split past the point of repair When Gemini fell from the sky And I held you so close like an angel As your delicate frame fell You streaked through the sky in a flame While the writers and poets all scurried Their pens all a flurry To capture the glimmering rain But the beautiful glow was the end of your road    
2918010	Nature	That stuff thatÂ's falling from the sky really isn't rain I'd put on a hat but its eating out my brain It's really all too late if only to explain  We messed with mother nature And now she's had enough Check mate is her final move There's no such call of bluff Not too long you'll really start to feel     
7722573	Nature	Standing on the nameless graves of victims slain just to please me* Tortured craving death as mercy Mangled so my whims be served Their life I claimed, stalked and reaped, Living they belonged solely to me To torque and shape as I demand Emperor in my ruthless dominion  Sovereignty of terror I uphold Treading placidly on moist soil While they rot beneath my feet Their putrescent decomposition summons my countless servants To gather for the decaying banquet

1679220	Nature	Sometimes it's very scary here, sometimes it's very sad, sometimes I think I'll disappear; betimes I think I have. There's a line snaking down my mirror, splintered glass distorts my face and though the light is strong and strange it can't illuminate the musty corners of this place. There is a lofty, lonely, Lohengrenic castle in the clouds; I draw my murky meanings there but seven years' dark luck is just around the corner and in the shadows lurks the spectre of Despair.  A cracked mirror 'mid the drapes of the landing: split image, labored understanding I'm only trying to find a place to hide my home.  I've lived in houses composed of glass where every movement is charted but now the monitor screens are dark and I can't tell if silent eyes are there. My words are spiders upon the page, they spin out faith, hope and reason - but are they meet and just, or only dust gathering about my chair? Sometimes I get the feeling that there's someone else there: the faceless watcher makes me uneasy; I can feel him through the floorboards, and His presence is creepy. He informs me that I shall be expelled. What is that but out of and into? I don't know the nature of the door that I'd go through, I don't know the nature of the nature that I am inside   I've lived in houses of brick and lead where all emotion is sacred and if you want to devour the fruit

11547174	Nature	In 89 they threw me under the water In the name of the Holy Spirit, Son, and the Father From this day forward I would always have a partner Someone to lean on as the times got harder But as the days got darker I began to question everything I was a part of Why the preacher always driving something so nice And why the leader of the choir ain’t got no wife So many things that didn’t flow right The ones who loved the most high always be the lowlifes So I expanded on my own route Read The Final Call, saw what Farakah was talking bout When I first quit pork it made my mother shout    
41015074	Nature	Seems like everybody now a days Is trucking down to the river or down to the lake With their moonshine, home-made wine, Flying high and in the mood.  Ha.

29905941	Nature	The Three Nails This is a story of long ago---of a man who owned a little store. As he would tell it, "I was proud to have my name above the door." This took place, oh, about two thousand years ago, as I recall, I was located in Jerusalem, just across the street from Pilate's hall.  And I had everything anyone would ever need; Why, folks would come from miles around, regardless of their creed. But there was only thing I had I thought would never sell, So I placed it in a corner on a shelf ----three old rusty spike nails.  Then one day a Roman soldier came through the door, And as he walked up to me, it seemed he shook the floor. I said, "Can I help you, Sir?" in a voice I 'm sure seemed frail. He looked at me with a sneering grin and said,

38187704	Nature	Oscar Wilde The Selfish Giant Note: Oscar Wilde intended this story to be read to children  Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden. It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them. ' How happy we are here!' they cried to each other. One day the Giant came back. He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years. After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle. When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden. What are you doing here?' he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away. My own garden is my own garden,' said the Giant; 'any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.' So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board. TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED  He was a very selfish Giant. The poor children had now nowhere to play. They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside. How happy we were there,' they said to each other. < 2 > Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still Winter. The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep. The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. ' Spring has forgotten this garden,' they cried, 'so we will live here all the year round.' The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came. He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down. '
