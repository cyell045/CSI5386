    > source activate <virtual env name> (e.g. NLPproject)
 - Navigate to directory containing this file
 - Make sure the data file is in the same directory and has the same name as the variable "dataFile" below after the imports
 - Set parameters as desired (highlighted in code with 50 * above and below)
